.. Getting Started

.. Installation and IDE
    To make your editing easier, we recommend to use VSCode editor with the extensions:
    - reStructuredText (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lextudio.restructuredtext)
    - Table Formatter (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shuworks.vscode-table-formatter)
.. 
    The prerequisites for those extensions are python3 and doc8 packcages. Install instructions are here:
    - https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/ (install python and pip, nothing else)
    - After this, use pip3 to install other prerequisites below:
    - https://docs.restructuredtext.net/articles/prerequisites.html

.. rst syntax quick reference
    If you are used to markdown, then rst is going to be a bit strange at first.
    rst is more powerful than markdown, and it is standardised.

    We put all link definitions (except from the page info header table) to the end of the document.

.. This is a document header
    It links to the epic ticket number, and provides document metadata

.. Template information:
    SPECIFICATION_NAME = name of the specification (title)
    EPIC = epic issue number
    AUTHOR = your name
    CREATED_AT = YYYY-MM-dd

.. Please replace the strings below with the values that you want to put in in all of the rst files of the specification.

1. Problem Definition
---------------------

* List your problem definition here

* User input
* Network-fetched information
* Existing information in the database

3. Outputs
------------

4. Use Case Scenarios
-----------------------

You can put general information or context for all use case scenarios here.
Feel free to remove the use case explanation below.

Every use case scenario consists of preconditions â€“ prerequisites
and assumptions, steps - numbered sequence of steps of the scenario,
from the user's perspective, and postconditions - results and
assumptions that must hold after the steps finished.

A use case can *inherit* another use case. That means that
inheriting use case takes all of the preconditions, steps, and postconditions
from the inhertied use case.

The inheriting (child) use case
can override (replace) any step or precondition in the parent
use case. The overriden steps in child should match the step number
in parent. The child use case may introduce sub-steps, in that case
numbering is starts with dot, for example "3.1", "3.2" gives more
details about step "3" of a parent use case.
