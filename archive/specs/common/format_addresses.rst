How to format addresses
=========================

This doc specifies the different types of formatting addresses inside the Safe apps.


Full address
------------

Used when the entire amount address should be displayed. 

- No truncation, always show all characters.
- Example: `0x3257bde8cf067ae6f1ddc0e4b140fe02e3c5e44f`


Full checksummed address
------------------------

Like full address but checksummed.

- No truncation, always show all characters.
- Address is checksummed.
- Example: `0x3257Bde8CF067aE6f1DDc0E4b140fe02e3C5e44f`


Short address
-------------------

Used in cases where horizontal screen real estate is limited and the complete address is not super important. 

- Take first 4 and last 4 digits only.
- Example: `0x32...5e44f`
