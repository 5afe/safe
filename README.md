# Creating a specification

Copy the `specs/_template` folder with all contents into a new folder and name it after the specification title,
lowercased, with underscores_instead_of_spaces.

We use `reStructuredText` for the specification documentation as at the moment it is more powerful, standardised and suited better for documneting software than the markdown format.

Where to put what:
- Put UI images into screens/platform subdirectories.
- Describe use case scenarios in the 01_main.rst document.
- You will find further information in other files in the _template directory.

If you have a first complete list of Problem statement, input, output and use case scenarios, then you can open a pull-request with `[WIP]` in the title.

Merged specifications considered ready for planning future releases and starting the development.
